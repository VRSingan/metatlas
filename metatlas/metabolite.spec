        object_id id - ID of the object assigned by the user or retreived from the IDserver (e.g. kb|g.0)
        object_type type - type of the object (e.g. Genome)
        timestamp moddate - date when the object was modified by the user (e.g. 2012-12-17T23:24:06)
        int instance - instance of the object, which is equal to the number of times the user has overwritten the object
        timestamp date_created - time at which the alignment was built/loaded in seconds since the epoch
        string command - name of the command last used to modify or create the object
        username lastmodifier - name of the user who last modified the object
        username owner - name of the user who owns (who created) this object
        workspace_id workspace - ID of the workspace in which the object is currently stored
        workspace_ref ref - a 36 character ID that provides permanent undeniable access to this specific instance of this object
        string chsum - checksum of the associated data object
        string metadata - custom metadata entered for data object during save operation

     *  name - This is the name and location of the file where it was uploaded to
     *  fid - This is the index in the SciDB array that identifies all the datapoints in your file
     *  polarity - User gets to Specify whether the file was acquired in positive or negative ionization mode
     *  group - A grouping descriptor to be used for analysis. Things like "control" and "treatment" for each file will allow those files to be grouped and processed by later code blocks
     *  inclusion_order - numerical values here to configure your plots to be in the order you want
     *  normalization_factor - A factor to divide the intensity of observed molecules by. This can partially correct for artifacts introduced by loading and extraction inconsistencies. Use with care and avoid by careful experimental design.
     *  retention_correction - A number (in minutes) to shift the retention time by
